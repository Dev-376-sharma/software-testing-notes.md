WEEK 6: Test Execution, Test Strategy & Test Planning (DETAILED)
1️⃣ What is Test Execution?
Test Execution is the process of:
Running test cases on the application and comparing expected results with actual results.

Simple Flow:
Test Case → Execute → Compare → Pass / Fail → Log Defect (if any)

📌 Key Point:
Test execution starts only after test cases & environment are ready.

2️⃣ Test Execution Process (Step-by-Step)
Review test cases
Prepare test data
Set up test environment
Execute test cases
Record actual results
Log defects
Re-test fixed defects
Perform regression testing

🧠 Interview line:
Test execution ensures software behaves as expected under defined conditions.

3️⃣ What is Test Strategy?
A Test Strategy is a high-level document that defines:
HOW testing will be done in the project.

Prepared By:
👉 Test Manager / Test Lead
Test Strategy Includes:
Scope of testing
Types of testing
Testing approach
Tools to be used
Risk analysis
Entry & Exit criteria

📌 Important:
Test strategy is common for multiple projects.

4️⃣ What is Test Plan?
A Test Plan is a detailed document that describes:
WHAT, WHEN, WHO, and HOW much testing will be done.

Prepared By:
👉 Test Lead / QA Manager
Test Plan Includes:
Objectives
Scope (in-scope / out-of-scope)
Test schedule
Resources
Test environment
Deliverables
Risks & mitigation

📌 Exam Tip:
Test plan is project-specific.

5️⃣ Test Strategy vs Test Plan (VERY IMPORTANT)
Test Strategy	Test Plan
High-level	Detailed
Organization-level	Project-level
Defines approach	Defines execution
Stable	Changes per project

🧠 Interview ready line:
Test strategy defines the testing approach, while test plan defines testing activities.

6️⃣ Entry Criteria & Exit Criteria (Revision + Depth)
🔹 Entry Criteria (Start Testing When):
Requirements approved
Test cases reviewed
Test environment ready
Build received

🔹 Exit Criteria (Stop Testing When):
All test cases executed
Critical defects fixed
Test coverage achieved
Test summary report prepared

7️⃣ What is Regression Testing?
Regression Testing ensures:
New changes did not break existing functionality.

📌 Example:
After fixing login bug → test signup, logout, dashboard again.

🧠 Important:
Regression testing is best suited for automation.

8️⃣ What is Re-Testing?

Re-Testing means:
Testing the same test case again after defect is fixed.

Re-Testing	Regression
Specific defect	Entire system
Manual mostly	Often automated

9️⃣ Test Environment
What is Test Environment?
Combination of:
Hardware
Software
Network
Test data

📌 Example:
Browser + OS + Database + Server

🧠 Exam Line:
A stable test environment ensures accurate test results.

🔟 Test Deliverables
Documents created during testing:
Test Plan
Test Cases
Defect Reports
Test Summary Report

🎯 Common Beginner Mistakes

❌ Starting execution without plan
❌ Skipping regression
❌ Poor environment setup
❌ Not updating test status
