WEEK 2: Software Testing Techniques (DETAILED NOTES)
1️⃣ What are Software Testing Techniques?
Testing techniques are methods used to design test cases in a systematic way so that:
Maximum defects are found
Minimum time & effort is used
Testing is not random

🧠 One-line exam answer:
Software testing techniques are structured approaches used to create effective test cases.

2️⃣ UI Testing (User Interface Testing)
What is UI Testing?
UI testing checks how the application looks and behaves from the user’s point of view.

It focuses on:
Screens
Buttons
Text boxes
Links
Colors
Layout

What do we check in UI Testing?
✅ Alignment of elements
✅ Font size & color
✅ Button functionality
✅ Labels & spelling
✅ Screen resolution compatibility

📌 Example: Login Page
Username field accepts input
Password is masked
Login button works
Error message appears for wrong login
UI Testing Example (Simple)

Test Case:
Test Case ID: UI_001
Scenario: Login Button Functionality
Steps:
1. Open login page
2. Enter valid username & password
3. Click login
Expected Result:
User should be redirected to dashboard

3️⃣ Usability Testing (MOST IMPORTANT)
What is Uability Testing?
Usability testing checks:
How easy and comfortable the software is for users.

It answers:
Is it easy to use?
Is navigation clear?
Can a normal user understand it?

🧠 Key Line:
Usability testing focuses on user experience, not just functionality.

Why Usability Testing Matters?
Users leave confusing apps
Poor UX = business loss
Good usability = user retention
📌 Real Example:
If users can’t find “Checkout” button → they won’t buy.

4️⃣ Types of Usability Testing
🔹 1. Exploratory Testing
No predefined test cases
Tester explores the app like a real user
Best for early stages
📌 Example:
Opening app and randomly checking flows.

🔹 2. Moderated Usability Testing
Real users + observer
Observer notes difficulties
📌 Used in:
Banking, healthcare apps

🔹 3. Unmoderated Usability Testing
Users test independently
Feedback recorded automatically
📌 Used in:
Large-scale apps

🔹 4. A/B Testing
Two versions teste
Best version selected
📌 Example:
Two “Buy Now” buttons → which gets more clicks?

5️⃣ Test Data – Meaning
What is Test Data?
Test Data is the input provided to the software to test its behavior.

🧠 Exam Line:
Test data is a set of values used to execute test cases.

6️⃣ Types of Test Data
🔹 1. Valid Test Data
Correct input
Expected to work
📌 Example:
Email: user@gmail.com

🔹 2. Invalid Test Data
Incorrect input
Tests error handling
📌 Example:
Email: user@

🔹 3. Boundary Test Data
Extreme values
📌 Example:
Password length: 8 → test 7, 8, 9

🔹 4. Negative Test Data
Unexpected inputs
📌 Example:
Special characters in name field

7️⃣ Preparing Test Data
Steps:
Understand requirements
Identify input fields
Decide valid/invalid cases
Create reusable datasets
Secure sensitive data

⚠️ Important:
Never use real customer data in testing.

🎯 Common Mistakes (Students Do This a LOT)
❌ Only testing happy path
❌ Ignoring UI alignment
❌ No negative test data
❌ Assuming usability = UI only

🧠 Interview-Ready Q&A
Q: Difference between UI & Usability Testing?
UI Testing	    Usability Testing
Look & feel	    User experience
Visual elements	Ease of use
Functional	Behavioral
