📅 WEEK 1: Introduction to Software Testing & Quality Basics

1️⃣ What is Software Testing?
Software Testing is the process of:
Finding defects (bugs) in software and ensuring it meets user requirements before release.

Why Testing is IMPORTANT?
Prevents financial loss 💰
Improves user trust 🙌
Ensures security & performance
Reduces future maintenance cost

📌 Real Example:
A payment app without testing → wrong balance → users lose money → company loses reputation.

2️⃣ Software Quality – Meaning & Importance
What is Software Quality?
Software quality means:
Software does what user expects
Works correctly, securely, and efficiently
Is easy to use and maintain

Key Quality Attributes:
Functionality
Reliability
Usability
Performance
Security
Maintainability

🧠 Easy line for exams/interviews:
Software quality ensures customer satisfaction by delivering defect-free and reliable software.

3️⃣ STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle)
STLC defines testing activities step-by-step.

STLC Phases:
Requirement Analysis
Test Planning
Test Case Design
Test Environment Setup
Test Execution
Test Cycle Closure

📌 Why STLC matters?
Proper planning
Less confusion
Better defect tracking
Higher quality product

4️⃣ V-Model (Verification & Validation Model)
What is V-Model?
It shows development & testing run in parallel.

Development Phase	Testing Phase
Requirements	Acceptance Testing
System Design	System Testing
Architecture Design	Integration Testing
Coding	Unit Testing

📌 Key Point:
Testing starts early, not after coding
🧠 Exam Tip:
V-Model reduces late defect detection.

5️⃣ Types of Software Testing (Intro)
Broad Types:
Manual Testing
Automation Testing

Functional Testing:
Unit Testing
Integration Testing
System Testing
User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
Non-Functional Testing:
Performance
Security
Usability
Compatibility

🎯 Common Beginner Mistakes
❌ Thinking testing = clicking randomly
❌ Ignoring requirements
❌ No documentation
❌ Late testing
