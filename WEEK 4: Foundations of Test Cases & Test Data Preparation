WEEK 4: Foundations of Test Cases & Test Data Preparation
1️⃣ What is a Test Case?
A Test Case is a set of steps written to verify whether a specific feature of the software is working as expected.

🧠 Simple definition (exam ready):
A test case is a document that describes the steps, input, and expected result to test a software feature.

2️⃣ Why Test Cases are IMPORTANT?

✅ Ensures proper coverage
✅ Avoids missing scenarios
✅ Helps new testers understand the system
✅ Useful for regression testing
✅ Acts as documentation

📌 Industry fact:
Companies do not test without test cases (except exploratory testing).

3️⃣ Standard Test Case Format

Most companies follow something close to this:
Field                	Description
Test Case ID	        Unique identifier
Test Scenario	        What to test
Preconditions	        Setup before testing
Test Steps	          Step-by-step actions
Test Data	            Input values
Expected Result	      What should happen
Actual Result	        What actually happened
Status	              Pass / Fail
Remarks              	Additional notes

4️⃣ Example: Login Page Test Case


Test Case ID: TC_LOGIN_01
Scenario: Verify login with valid credentials

Preconditions:
User must be registered

Steps:
Open login page
Enter valid username
Enter valid password
Click Login

Test Data:
Username: test@gmail.com
Password: Test@123

Expected Result:
User should be redirected to dashboard
Status: Pass

5️⃣ What is a Test Suite?
A Test Suite is a collection of related test cases.

📌 Example:
Login Test Suite contains:
Valid login test
Invalid login test
Blank fields test
Forgot password test

🧠 One-liner:
Test suite groups similar test cases together.

6️⃣ Executing Test Cases
Test Execution means:
Running test cases and comparing expected vs actual results.

Steps:
Prepare test environment
Execute test cases
Note actual results
Mark Pass/Fail
Report defects if any

📌 Real Life:
If expected ≠ actual → BUG FOUND

7️⃣ Recording Test Results

After execution, results are recorded as:
Pass – Feature works as expected
Fail – Mismatch found
Blocked – Cannot test due to dependency
Not Executed – Test not run yet

🧠 Interview Tip:
Blocked ≠ Failed

8️⃣ Defect (Bug) Tracking – Intro
A Defect/Bug is:
A deviation between expected and actual result.

When do we log a bug?
Test case fails
Application crashes
Incorrect behavior observed

📌 Example:
Password field accepts only 6 chars but requirement says 8.

9️⃣ Entry Criteria & Exit Criteria (VERY IMPORTANT)
🔹 Entry Criteria
Conditions that must be met before testing starts.

Examples:
Requirements approved
Test cases ready
Test environment available

🔹 Exit Criteria
Conditions to stop testing.
Examples:
All test cases executed
Critical bugs fixed
Test coverage achieved

🧠 Easy difference:
Entry → When to START
Exit → When to STOP

🎯 Common Beginner Mistakes

❌ Writing vague test steps
❌ Missing expected results
❌ Not updating test status
❌ Logging duplicate bugs
