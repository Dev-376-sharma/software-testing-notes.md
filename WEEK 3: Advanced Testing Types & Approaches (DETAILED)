WEEK 3: Advanced Testing Types & Approaches (DETAILED)
1️⃣ Manual Testing vs Automation Testing
🔹 Manual Testing
Manual Testing means:
Testing the software by a human without using scripts or tools.

Where Manual Testing is Used?
New features
UI & usability
Exploratory testing
Small projects

Advantages:
✅ Easy to start
✅ Better for UX issues
✅ No coding needed

Disadvantages:
❌ Time-consuming
❌ Repetitive work
❌ Human errors possible

📌 Example:
Testing login page manually by entering different usernames/passwords.

🔹 Automation Testing
Automation Testing means:
Using tools/scripts to test software automatically.

Where Automation is Used?
Regression testing
Load testing
Repetitive test cases
Large projects

Advantages:
✅ Fast execution
✅ High accuracy
✅ Saves time long-term

Disadvantages:
❌ Initial setup cost
❌ Requires coding knowledge
❌ Not good for usability testing

📌 Example:
Using Selenium to test login functionality multiple times.

🧠 Manual vs Automation (Exam Table)
Manual Testing	     Automation Testing
Human effort	       Tool-based
Slow	               Fast
Less cost initially	 High setup cost
Better for UI/UX	   Better for regression

2️⃣ Different Types of Testing (Overview)
Testing can be classified based on levels & purpose.

3️⃣ Integration Testing
What is Integration Testing?
Integration testing checks:
Whether modules work correctly when combined.

Why Needed?
Individual modules may work fine
Errors occur when they interact

Types of Integration Testing:
🔹 Top-Down
Main module tested first
Sub-modules added later
Uses stubs

🔹 Bottom-Up
Low-level modules tested first
Uses drivers

🔹 Big Bang
All modules integrated at once
Hard to debug

📌 Example:
Login module + Database module + Dashboard module.

4️⃣ System Testing
What is System Testing?
System testing checks:
The complete system as a whole against requirements.

Who Performs It?

👉 Testers (QA team)
Types under System Testing:
Functional testing
Performance testing
Security testing
Usability testing

📌 Example:
Testing an entire e-commerce website before release.

🧠 Exam Line:
System testing is done after integration testing.

5️⃣ User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
What is UAT?
UAT is performed to:
Verify the software is acceptable to the end user/client.

Who Performs UAT?
Client
Business users
End users

When?
After system testing
Before production release

📌 Example:
Client checks whether billing system meets business needs.

🧠 Important:
If UAT fails → software is NOT released.

6️⃣ Testing Levels (Quick View)
Level	Done By	Purpose
Unit Testing	Developers	Test individual units
Integration Testing	Testers	Test module interaction
System Testing	Testers	Test whole system
UAT	Users/Clients	Business validation

🎯 Common Beginner Mistakes
❌ Skipping integration testing
❌ Automating everything blindly
❌ Confusing UAT with system testing
❌ Ignoring user feedback

🧠 Interview Questions (VERY IMPORTANT)
Q: Why not automate everything?
➡ Some tests require human judgment (UI/UX).

Q: Difference between System Testing & UAT?
➡ System testing = technical
➡ UAT = business validation
